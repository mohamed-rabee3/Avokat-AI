# Enhanced Retrieval System - Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the retrieval system for the Avokat-AI legal chatbot. The enhanced system addresses critical issues in knowledge graph querying and provides better support for both Arabic and English queries.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Ineffective Search Term Extraction**
- **Problem**: The original `_extract_search_terms()` method was overly complex and mapped too many terms to "عقد" (contract), making queries too generic.
- **Impact**: Queries became too broad, reducing precision and relevance.

### 2. **Poor Cypher Query Structure**
- **Problem**: Basic `CONTAINS` matching without leveraging Neo4j's graph traversal capabilities.
- **Impact**: Inefficient queries that don't utilize the graph structure effectively.

### 3. **Limited Graph Traversal**
- **Problem**: System didn't follow relationships to find connected entities.
- **Impact**: Missing important context and related information.

### 4. **Inadequate Multilingual Support**
- **Problem**: Search didn't properly handle Arabic-English mixed queries or Arabic-specific patterns.
- **Impact**: Poor performance on Arabic queries and mixed-language scenarios.

### 5. **Semantic Search Issues**
- **Problem**: Low similarity threshold (0.3) and poor integration with graph-based retrieval.
- **Impact**: Irrelevant results and poor context quality.

## Enhanced Retrieval Architecture

### **Hybrid Approach**
The new system implements a hybrid retrieval approach combining:

1. **Semantic Search** - For document chunk relevance
2. **Graph Traversal** - For entity and relationship discovery
3. **Context Expansion** - For related information retrieval
4. **Multilingual Processing** - For Arabic/English support

### **Retrieval Pipeline**

```
User Query → Language Detection → Search Term Extraction
    ↓
Semantic Search (Document Chunks) + Graph Traversal (Entities/Relationships)
    ↓
Context Expansion (Follow Relationships) → Result Aggregation
    ↓
Enhanced Context Prompt → LLM Generation
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Semantic Search**

**Before:**
```python
# Low threshold, poor relevance
context_chunks = [chunk['content'] for chunk in top_chunks if chunk['similarity'] > 0.3]
```

**After:**
```python
# Higher threshold, better relevance
context_chunks = [chunk['content'] for chunk in top_chunks if chunk['similarity'] > 0.5]
```

**Benefits:**
- Higher similarity threshold (0.5) ensures better relevance
- More precise document content retrieval
- Reduced noise in context

### 2. **Improved Search Term Extraction**

**Before:**
- Complex translation mapping
- Over-mapping to generic terms
- 200+ lines of hardcoded mappings

**After:**
```python
def _extract_meaningful_terms(self, query: str, language: str) -> List[str]:
    # Simple, effective term extraction
    question_words = {
        'english': ['what', 'is', 'are', 'in', 'the', 'a', 'an', 'and', 'or', 'but', 'for', 'with', 'by', 'how', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'who', 'which', 'tell', 'me', 'about', 'can', 'you', 'please'],
        'arabic': ['ماذا', 'ما', 'هو', 'هي', 'في', 'من', 'إلى', 'على', 'مع', 'ب', 'ل', 'كيف', 'متى', 'أين', 'لماذا', 'من', 'أي', 'أخبر', 'ني', 'عن', 'هل', 'يمكن', 'أن', 'تخبرني']
    }
    
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', cleaned_query)
    meaningful_words = [word for word in words if word not in question_words['english'] and word not in question_words['arabic']]
    
    return meaningful_words if meaningful_words else [cleaned_query]
```

**Benefits:**
- Simplified logic (20 lines vs 200+ lines)
- Better preservation of original query intent
- More effective multilingual support

### 3. **Graph Traversal with Relevance Scoring**

**Before:**
```cypher
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.session_id = $session_id AND toLower(n.name) CONTAINS $query_text
RETURN n
```

**After:**
```cypher
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.session_id = $session_id AND (search_conditions)
WITH n, 
     CASE 
         WHEN n.content IS NOT NULL AND (search_conditions) THEN 1
         WHEN n.name IS NOT NULL AND (search_conditions) THEN 2
         WHEN n.description IS NOT NULL AND (search_conditions) THEN 3
         ELSE 4
     END as relevance_score
ORDER BY relevance_score, n.created_at DESC
RETURN n as entity, relevance_score
```

**Benefits:**
- Relevance scoring for better result ranking
- Multiple search conditions for comprehensive matching
- Temporal ordering for recent content priority

### 4. **Context Expansion Through Relationships**

**New Feature:**
```python
def _expand_context_by_relationships(self, session, entities, relationships, session_id, limit):
    """Expand context by following relationships from found entities"""
    expansion_query = """
    MATCH (n)-[r]-(related)
    WHERE n.session_id = $session_id 
    AND (n.id IN $entity_ids OR related.id IN $entity_ids)
    AND related.session_id = $session_id
    RETURN DISTINCT related as expanded_entity, r as expanded_relationship, 
           labels(n)[0] as source_type, labels(related)[0] as target_type,
           type(r) as relationship_type
    LIMIT $limit
    """
```

**Benefits:**
- Discovers related entities and relationships
- Provides richer context for LLM
- Leverages graph structure effectively

### 5. **Enhanced Context Prompt Structure**

**Before:**
```
=== ENTITIES ===
=== RELATIONSHIPS ===
=== CONTEXT ===
```

**After:**
```
=== ENTITIES FROM DOCUMENTS ===
=== RELATIONSHIPS ===
=== RELATED INFORMATION ===
=== DOCUMENT CONTENT ===
=== SEARCH TERMS USED ===
```

**Benefits:**
- Better organization of context information
- Transparency in search process
- Enhanced entity information with relevance scores
- Related information for comprehensive understanding

## Multilingual Improvements

### **Arabic Query Support**

**Enhanced Features:**
1. **Better Arabic Question Word Filtering**
   - Comprehensive list of Arabic question words
   - Proper handling of Arabic text patterns

2. **Mixed Language Queries**
   - Support for queries mixing Arabic and English
   - Language detection for appropriate processing

3. **Arabic-Specific Search Patterns**
   - Recognition of Arabic legal terminology
   - Proper handling of Arabic text in Cypher queries

### **Language Detection Integration**

```python
# Detect language if not provided
if not language:
    language = self.language_detector.detect_language(query)

# Apply language-specific processing
if language and language != "mixed":
    cypher_query = cypher_query.replace(
        "WHERE n.session_id = $session_id",
        f"WHERE n.session_id = $session_id AND n.language = '{language}'"
    )
```

## Performance Optimizations

- Mixed language queries
- Session statistics
- Error handling

### **Specific Query Fix**

The problematic query "ماذا يوجد فالملف" (what is in the file) has been fixed with:

1. **Arabic compound word mapping**: "فالملف" → "ملف"
2. **General content query detection**: Recognizes queries asking about file content
3. **Multiple search terms**: Uses `["عقد", "مستند", "محتوى"]` for broader coverage
4. **Dynamic similarity threshold**: Uses 0.2 for general queries vs 0.5 for specific ones
5. **Enhanced question word filtering**: Removes more Arabic question words like "يوجد", "موجود", "يحتوي"

### **Complete Document Coverage**

The system now ensures 100% document coverage by:

1. **Always returning ALL document chunks**: No more similarity thresholds for document content
2. **Semantic search only for Knowledge Graph**: Uses embeddings only for finding relevant entities/relationships
3. **Comprehensive context**: LLM always has access to complete document content
4. **Fixed graph traversal errors**: Resolved variable scope issues in entity search

## Usage Examples

### **English Query**
```python
result = retrieval_service.retrieve_entities_and_relationships(
    query="tell me about the contract",
    session_id=1,
    language="english",
    limit=10
)
```

### **Arabic Query**
```python
result = retrieval_service.retrieve_entities_and_relationships(
    query="أخبرني عن العقد",
    session_id=1,
    language="arabic",
    limit=10
)
```

### **Mixed Language Query**
```python
result = retrieval_service.retrieve_entities_and_relationships(
    query="tell me about العقد",
    session_id=1,
    language="mixed",
    limit=10
)
```

## Expected Results
