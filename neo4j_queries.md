## Usage Instructions

1. **Open Neo4j Aura Browser**: Go to your Neo4j Aura console and open the browser
2. **Connect to Database**: Make sure you're connected to the correct database
3. **Run Queries**: Copy and paste any of the above queries into the query editor
4. **Modify Session ID**: Replace `session_id = 1` with your actual session ID
5. **Adjust Limits**: Modify `LIMIT` values based on your data size

## Tips

- Start with basic queries (#1-3) to get an overview
- Use session-specific queries (#4-6) to focus on specific data
- Explore different node types (#7-20) to understand your data structure
- Use advanced queries (#21-25) for deeper analysis
- Always be careful with deletion queries (#26-27)

## Common Modifications

- **Change Session ID**: Replace `1` with your session ID in WHERE clauses
- **Add More Filters**: Add additional WHERE conditions to narrow results
- **Sort Results**: Add `ORDER BY` clauses to sort by different properties
- **Limit Results**: Adjust `LIMIT` values to control result size
